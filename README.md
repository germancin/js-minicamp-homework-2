	* `for` : Is a way we can do a task over and over again until a condition is achived!.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` : These symbols are used to create logical statememts such as (if 3 is greater than 4 OR 6 is greater than 7)
	                     In the previous example I am using th logcical operator 'OR' which in language programing is represented as
			     || (doble pipe). In the same way we have the symbol doble ampersant && which means 'AND'. Also we have the
			     symbol ! which means basically 'NO'.  
	* Arrays: Array is a group of elements inside a box represented in this way in programing Ex. [ 1, 'a', -2, fnc() ].
	* Git: Is a software used to control every change is done into a document or inside a folder as well.
